title: "4.1 Tasks: Blackbox exporter"
weight: 2
sectionnumber: 1
---

### Task 1

* Download and extract the latest version of [blackbox_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases) and execute it (use the same `~/downloads` and `~/work` directories as in the previous labs)
* Create a new module in the blackbox exporter config (`blackbox.yml`) which uses the HTTP prober and expects a 418 return code as a valid status code
* Add a job to the Prometheus `scrape_configs` which scrapes the blackbox exporter using the newly created module and `https://httpstat.us/418` as a single static target

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You need to reload the blackbox exporter and Prometheus after making changes to their configuration files.

```bash
killall -HUP blackbox_exporter
killall -HUP prometheus
```

{{% /alert %}}

### Task 2

* In the Prometheus expression browser, display all metrics belonging to the target `https://httpstat.us/418`

### Task 3 (optional)

* Add a new label `protocol` to every target by updating the relabel config. The new label should contain the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) extracted from the target URL

```bash
cd ~/downloads
curl -L -O https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/releases/download/v0.18.0/blackbox_exporter-0.18.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar fvxz blackbox_exporter-0.18.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C ~/work
cd ~/work/blackbox_exporter-0.18.0.linux-amd64
./blackbox_exporter &
```

`blackbox.yml`

```yaml
modules:
  ...
  http_418:
    prober: http
    http:
      valid_status_codes: [418]
...
```

Prometheus `scrape_config`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_418] # use the module name defined in the blackbox.yml
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - https://httpstat.us/418
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115
```

**Warning:** In the list of metrics you will find one metric with the name `up`. In the case of a multi-target exporter such as the blackbox exporter this metric will always be up as long as Prometheus is able to successfully scrape the exporter even if the actual target (website, TCP service, etc.) is down. To monitor the state of the targets always use the `probe_success` metric.
