### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Add add blackbox target

We will add the pre-installed blackbox exporter to our Prometheus configuration and create a new module which accepts a `418` return code as a valid http return code. This will return the `probe_success` metric from the blackbox exporter with the value `1`, if the http status code is `418`.

**Task description**:

* Create a new module in the blackbox exporter config (`/etc/blackbox_exporter.yml`) which uses the HTTP prober and expects a `418` return code as a valid status code
* Add a job to the Prometheus `scrape_configs` which scrapes the blackbox exporter using the newly created module
* Define `https://httpstat.us/418` as a single static target, which the blackbox should probe

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You need to reload the blackbox exporter and Prometheus after making changes to their configuration files.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload blackbox_exporter
sudo systemctl reload prometheus
```

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

`/etc/blackbox_exporter.yml`

```yaml
modules:
  ...
  http_418:
    prober: http
    http:
      preferred_ip_protocol: ip4
      valid_status_codes:
      - 418
...
```

`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe #1
    params:
      module: [http_418] #2
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - https://httpstat.us/418 #3
    relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__address__] #4
      target_label: __param_target
    - source_labels: [__param_target] #5
      target_label: instance
    - target_label: __address__ #6
      replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115
```

Without the `params` and `relabel_config`, the target url would look like this: https://httpstat.us/probe

* __1__: The `/metrics` metrics_path exposes blackbox internal metrics. The `/probe` metrics_path will give you metrics about the specified external endpoint
* __2__: Use the `http_418` module defined in the blackbox.yml.

The url looks now like this: https://httpstat.us/probe&module=http_418

* __3__: Define the external targets the blackbox exporter should probe
* __4__: The `__address__` label holds the values from the in __3__ specified targets. We will write these to the `__param_target` label.

The url look now like this: https://httpstat.us/probe?target=https://httpstat.us/418&module=http_418

* __5__: Now we will write the values from the `__param_target` label to the `instance` label. Like this we will later be able to use the label `instance` to filter our targets in our queries.
* __6__: At last we set the `__address__` label to our blackbox exporter address, which will then be used as our blackbox exporter hostname and port

Finally the url looks now like this: http://127.0.0.1:9115/probe?target=https://httpstat.us/418&module=http_418

You can verify this by directly running a curl on this url. The `probe_success` metric should have the value `1`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:9115/probe?target=https://httpstat.us/418&module=http_418"
```

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Query blackbox metrics

**Task description**: Display all metrics belonging to the target `https://httpstat.us/418` in the Prometheus expression browser.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Use the following expression,

```promql
{instance="https://httpstat.us/418"}
```

or directly navigate to your [Prometheus instance](http://LOCALHOST:9090/graph?g0.range_input=1h&g0.expr=%7Binstance%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fhttpstat.us%2F418%22%7D&g0.tab=1)


{{% alert title="Warning" color="primary" %}}
In the list of metrics you will find one metric with the name `up`. In the case of a multi-target exporter such as the blackbox exporter this metric will always be up as long as Prometheus is able to successfully scrape the exporter even if the actual target (website, TCP service, etc.) is down. To monitor the state of the targets always use the `probe_success` metric.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3 (optional): Add a protocol label to your blackbox target

**Task description**: Add the new label `protocol` to every blackbox exporter target by updating the relabel config. The new label should contain the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) extracted from the target URL.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_418] # use the module name defined in the blackbox.yml
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - https://httpstat.us/418
    relabel_configs:
    - source_labels: [__address__]
      target_label: __param_target
    - source_labels: [__param_target]
      target_label: instance
    - target_label: __address__
      replacement: 127.0.0.1:9115
    - source_labels: [instance] #1
      target_label: protocol #2
      regex: '^(.+):.+' #3
      replacement: $1 #4
```

* __1__: Use the value from the label `instance`. This label contains all targets defined at `static_configs.targets`
* __2__: We will call the new label `protocol`
* __3__: Capture the first part of your url until `:`. In our case `https` from `https://httpstat.us/418`
* __4__: Replace `target_label` value with the regex match from `source_labels` value
