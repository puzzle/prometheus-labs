## Installation

### Setup

Before we can define rules for alerting, we must install Alertmanager by downloading and extracting the binary.

1. Create a working directory where we will download and extract Alertmanager. Open a new terminal, navigate to your home directory, and create a new directory called `alertmanager`:

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/alertmanager
    cd ~/alertmanager
    ```

1. Download Alertmanager:

    ```bash
    curl -L -O https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases/download/v0.21.0/alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

    {{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Binaries for other CPU architectures, such as ARM or other operating systems (e.g., Darwin, BSD, Windows) are available on the release page of Alertmanager: <https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/releases>
    {{% /alert %}}

1. Extract the archive:

    ```bash
    tar fvxz alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ```

1. Examine the contents of the tarball

    If you check the output of the previous tar command, you should see a list of extracted files. We will now take a closer look at some of these files:

    * `alertmanager`

       This is the Alertmanager binary.

    * `amtool`

      This is a useful tool which can be used for debugging, testing, silencing, and other tasks related to Alertmanager.

    * `alertmanager.yml`

      This is the configuration file of Alertmanager. More on that in the next section.


### Configuration

The configuration of Alertmanager is done using a YAML config file and CLI flags. The Alertmanager tarball we downloaded earlier includes a very basic configuration file:

```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: 'web.hook'
receivers:
- name: 'web.hook'
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
inhibit_rules:
  - source_match:
      severity: 'critical'
    target_match:
      severity: 'warning'
    equal: ['alertname', 'dev', 'instance']
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
For the moment we leave it with the default configuration and come back to it later in the course.
{{% /alert %}}

### Run Alertmanager

To run Alertmanager you can simply execute the `alertmanager` binary and point it to its configuration file:

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the extracted Alertmanager folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/alertmanager/alertmanager-0.21.0.linux-amd64
    ```

1. Start Alertmanager by executing the binary:

    ```bash
    ./alertmanager --config.file=alertmanager.yml &
    ```

1. You should now see Alertmanager starting up with the log line `msg=Listening address=:9093."`. To verify this open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093). You should now see the Alertmanager web UI.

Before moving on, let's make some warm-up [labs for monitoring your Alertmanager](labs/31).

## Configuration in Alertmanager

There are two main sections for configuring how Alertmanager is dispatching alerts: receivers and routing.

### Receivers

With a [receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#receiver), one or more notifications can be defined. There are different types of notifications types, e.g. mail, webhook, or one of the message platforms like Slack or PagerDuty.

### Routing

With [routing blocks](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/#route), a tree of routes and child routes can be defined. Each routing block has a matcher which can match one or several labels of an alert. Per block, one receiver can be specified, or if empty, the default receiver is taken.

### amtool

As routing definitions might be very complex and hard to understand, [amtool](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager#examples) becomes handy as it helps to test the rules. It can also generate test alerts and has even more useful features. More about this in the labs.

### More (advanced) options

For more insights of the configuration options, study the following resources:

* Example configuration provided by [Alertmanager on GitHub](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/master/doc/examples/simple.yml)
* General overview of [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/)

Before we enable Alertmanager in Prometheus, let's do some [labs concerning the Alertmanager](labs/32).

## Enable Alertmanager in Prometheus

The Alertmanager instance we installed before must be configured in Prometheus. Open `prometheus.yml`, add the config below, and reload the Prometheus config with `killall -HUP prometheus`.

```yaml
# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - static_configs:
    - targets:
       - localhost:9093
```

## Alert rules in Prometheus

[Prometheus alert rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) are configured very similarly to recording rules which you got to know [earlier in this training](/docs/02#recording-rules). The main difference is that the rule's expression contains a threshold (e.g., `query_expression >= 5`) and that an alert is sent to the Alertmanager in case the rule evaluation matches the threshold. An alert rule can be based on a recording rule or be a normal expression query.

Now it's time for the last [labs concerning alertrules and alerts](labs/33).
