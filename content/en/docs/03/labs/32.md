### Task 1

* Define an alert rule which sents an alert when a target is down
* Wait time until the alarm should be sent is 2 minutes
* Give the necessary information about which instance and job is down

### Task 2

* Kill or stop the sample application
* What do you observe in Prometheus UI or in Alertmanager UI?

### Task 3

* There are failures in Alertmanager, can you find them?

## Solutions

{{% details title="Task 1" %}}

Create a new file `alertrule.yml` and add the following snippet:

```yaml
groups:
- name: basic
  rules:
  - alert: Up
    expr: up == 0
    for: 2m
    labels:
      severity: page
    annotations:
      summary: Instance {{ $labels.instance }} of job {{ $labels.job }} is down
```

In `prometheus.yml` add the rule file at `rule_files` section and restart or reload Prometheus.

```yaml

  rule_files:
  # - "first_rules.yml"
  # - "second_rules.yml"
  - alertrule.yml
```

* In the Prometheus UI there is an [alert console](http://localhost:9090/alerts) which shows you information about inactive and active alerts.
* As soon as an alert is in state `FIRING` the alert is sent to Alertmanager. You should see the alert in its [webinterface](http://localhost:9093/).

As alertmanager is monitored by Prometheus, start typing `alertmanager_fail` and
look for a metric which could help you out.

```
alertmanager_notifications_failed_total
```

This means alerts are received by Alertmanager but cannot be sent to the final destination! We handle this in the next part of the course.
