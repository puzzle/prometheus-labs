We provide a training app which simulates a webhook receiver. This simulation just prints the alerts it gets. Before we go on, we must install the training app and start the webook receiver:

```bash
cd ~/downloads
curl -L -O https://github.com/acend/prometheus-training-app/releases/download/v0.0.2/prometheus-training-app-v0.0.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mkdir ~/work/prometheus-training-app-v0.0.2-linux-amd64 && tar fvxz prometheus-training-app-v0.0.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C $_
cd ~/work/prometheus-training-app-v0.0.2-linux-amd64
./prometheus-training-app webhook &
```

The URL of this webhook receiver is `http://localhost:5001/`.
{{% /alert %}}

### Task 1

* Use the `amtool` command to send a test alert

### Task 2

* Configure one receiver `receiver-a` which notifies webhook `http://127.0.0.1:5001`
* Define a route so that `receiver-a` is notified when the label `team=team-a` is set
* Use `amtool` to validate your configuration
* Use `amtool` to show your routing configuration
* Use `amtool` to test your routing configuration

### Task 3

* Configure another receiver `receiver-b` to send a mail
  * from `prometheus@localhost`
  * to `alert@localhost`
  * SMTP Server `localhost:1025`
  * disable TLS
* Define a route so that _both_ receivers (A and B) are notified
* Use `amtool` to test your routing configuration
* Send a test alert and verify the mails on mailcatcher `http://127.0.0.1:1080`

### Next step

Continue with [Enable Alertmanager in Prometheus](../../#enable-alertmanager-in-prometheus).

## Solutions

{{% details title="Task 1" %}}

Send test alerts, e.g.

```
amtool alert add --alertmanager.url=http://localhost:9093 alertname=Up node=bar
```

{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 2" %}}

Add the receiver and the route in `/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`:

```yaml
...
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: 'web.hook'
  routes:
    - receiver: 'receiver-a'
      match:
        team: 'team-a'
receivers:
  - name: 'web.hook'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
  - name: 'receiver-a'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
...
```

Check the configuration:

```bash
amtool check-config alertmanager.yml
```

```
Checking 'alertmanager.yml'  SUCCESS
Found:
 - global config
 - route
 - 1 inhibit rules
 - 2 receivers
 - 0 templates
```

Show routing tree:

```bash
amtool config routes --config.file alertmanager.yml
```

```
Routing tree:
.
└── default-route  receiver: web.hook
    └── {team="team-a"}  receiver: receiver-a
```

Test routing configuration:

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file alertmanager.yml team=team-a
```

```
receiver-a
```

{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 3" %}}

In `/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` add the receiver and the route.

```yaml
...
route:
  group_by: ['alertname']
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 1h
  receiver: 'web.hook'
  routes:
    - receiver: 'receiver-a'
      match:
        team: 'team-a'
      continue: true
    - receiver: 'receiver-b'
      match_re:
        team: 'team-[a|b]'
receivers:
  - name: 'web.hook'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
  - name: 'receiver-a'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5001/'
  - name: 'receiver-b'
    email_configs:
      - to: 'alert@localhost'
        from: 'prometheus@localhost'
        smarthost: 'localhost:1025'
        require_tls: false
...
```

Use again `amtool` for checking your routing configuration:

```bash
amtool config routes --config.file alertmanager.yml
```

```
Routing tree:
.
└── default-route  receiver: web.hook
    ├── {team="team-a"}  continue: true  receiver: receiver-a
    └── {team=~"^(?:team-[a|b])$"}  receiver: receiver-b
```

Add a test alert and check if the mailcatcher received the mail

```bash
amtool alert add --alertmanager.url http://localhost:9093 team=team-a
```

It is also possible to validate the routing configuration against a test dataset to avoid unintended changes. With the option `--verify.receivers` the expected output can be specified:

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file alertmanager.yml --verify.receivers=receiver-a team=team-a
```

```
receiver-a,receiver-b
WARNING: Expected receivers did not match resolved receivers.
```

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file alertmanager.yml --verify.receivers=receiver-a team=team-b
```

```
receiver-b
WARNING: Expected receivers did not match resolved receivers.
```

```bash
amtool config routes test --config.file alertmanager.yml --verify.receivers=receiver-b team=team-b
```

```
receiver-b
```
