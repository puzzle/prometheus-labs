### Task 1 Create a service monitor for the example application

* Create a service monitor (hint: `kubectl apply -f servicemonitor.yaml -n application-metrics` will create a resource in the kubernetes namespace), which will configure prometheus to scrape the metrics of the example-web-python application every 30 seconds.

For this to work properly make sure:

* the example-web-python service is labeled correctly, same label as you've defined in your service monitor.
* the port name in your service monitor configuration, matches the name in the service (hint: check with `kubectl get service example-web-python -n application-metrics`)

Verify:

* To verify that, check the prometheus webconsole

Bestpractices Troubleshooting if no metrics are scraped

does the scrape config of the service monitor appear in the prometheus scrape config ?

if not:

* Check whether you need to label your Serivce Monitor, to be picked up by the operator

The endoint appears in the prometheus scrape config but not under targets

* This means, that service discovery doesn't find the endpoint.
  * the namespaceSelector in the service monitor is set wrong
  * the selector lable doesn't find a matchin service
  * the port name in the service does not match

* No data can be scraped
  * does the application provide metrics under the correct path and port

### Task 2 Deploy a database and use a sidecar container to expose metrics (optional)

As we've learnt in the [lab 4](../04/) if applications don't expose metrics in the prometheus format already, there are a lot of exporters awailable, which convert metrics into the needed format. In Kubernetes this is often done, by deploying so called sidecar containers along with the acutal application.

Use the following command to deploy a maria database in the `application-metrics` namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f FIXME mariadb.yaml -n application-metrics
```

This will create a `secret` (username password to access the database), a `service` and the `deployment`

* Deploy the [mariadb exporter as sidecar container](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) as docker container: <https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter/>
  * hint: alter the mariadb deployment, download the mariadb.yaml file and edit it (use `kubectl apply -f mariadb.yaml -n application-metrics` to apply it)
* create a service monitor, which will configure prometheus to scrape the sidecar container.


### Task 3 Probes (optional)

In [lab 4 exporters](../04/) we've encountered the Blackbox exporter and learnt how a multi-target exporter can be configured using kind of hard to understand relabel_configs.

The CoreOS Prometheus Operator brings us so called probe custom resource, which allow us to easily define the targets for a Blackboxexporter.

* Create a probe custom resource in the application-metrics namespace for the example-web-python application

hint: use `kubectl describe crd probe` to describe the crd


## Solutions

{{% details title="Task 1" %}}

Create the following service monitor (`~/work/servicemonitor.yaml`) in the `application-metrics` namespace

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/servicemonitor.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Apply it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/work/servicemonitor.yaml -n application-metrics
```

{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 2" %}}

First we need to

* alter the deployemnt of the mariadb and add a second container for the mariadb exporter
* and alter the service add a second port for the mariadb-exporter

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/mariadb-sidecar.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

We can apply the file above using `kubectl apply -f mariadb-sidecar.yaml -n application-metrics`

Then we also need to create a new service monitor

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

`kubectl apply -f servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml -n application-metrics`


{{% /details %}}

{{% details title="Task 3" %}}

Create the following probe custom resource (`~/work/probe.yaml`) in the `application-metrics` namespace

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/08/labs/probe.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Apply it using the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/work/probe.yaml -n application-metrics
```
