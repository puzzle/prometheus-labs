## Setup Introduction

If you run this techlab on your own workstation a basic
[Vagrantfile][vagrantfile] is provided to get your lab
environment up and running in a matter of minutes.

Follow the instructions on the subsequent pages to complete
the setup on your platform of choice.

Currently a setup guide for Linux and Windows exists.
